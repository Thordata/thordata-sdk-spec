apiTraffic:
  trustEnv: true
  notes:
    - "API calls may respect HTTP(S)_PROXY environment variables for users behind local proxies."

proxyGatewayTraffic:
  trustEnv: false
  notes:
    - "Proxy gateway traffic may bypass environment proxies by design to avoid routing API calls through the proxy gateway."

chinaNotes:
  - "In restricted networks, prefer system-level tunneling (e.g., TUN mode) or routing that allows reaching Thordata gateway hosts."
